# 🌱 PlantUnify

**A Unified Manufacturing Data Platform**  
Hackathon Submission for **Summer Open 2025**

## 🚀 Overview

**PlantUnify** is a centralized data platform that ingests, standardizes, and visualizes production reports from seven independent manufacturing plants. Each plant had historically used inconsistent Excel formats, making performance tracking and decision-making at HQ time-consuming and error-prone.

Our solution automates this process end-to-end.
